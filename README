JarMath
===========

JarMath is a personal package I threw together that contains all of my statistical and filtering functions
that I use throughout my own financial analytics scripts::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import jarmath

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
and ``monospace`` look like this.



=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

  A Sub-Section
  -------------

  Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

  1. hi there

  2. must be going
