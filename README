JarMath
===========

JarMath is a personal package I threw together that contains all of my statistical and filtering functions
that I use throughout my own financial analytics scripts::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import jarmath

To use a function:
    
    e.g. average_price = jarmath.moving_average(price, window)
